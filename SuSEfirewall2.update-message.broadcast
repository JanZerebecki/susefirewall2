FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST and FW_IGNORE_FW_BROADCAST in
/etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 are now obsolete and are replaced by zone
specific variables (like e.g. FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST_EXT). Your old settings
have been converted to the new syntax as far as possible. Please verify
that the firewall configuration still suits your needs.
