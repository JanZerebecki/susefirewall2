FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST and FW_IGNORE_FW_BROADCAST in
/etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 are now obsolete and are replaced by
zone-specific variables, like FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST_EXT. Your old
settings have been converted to the new syntax as far as possible.
Verify that the firewall configuration still suits your needs.
