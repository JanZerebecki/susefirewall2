v3.1	31.08.02
	* Speeeeed increase. Runs approx. 20% faster now as I removed lots
	  of unnecessary execs
	* Fixed a small bug in accepting related and established sessions
	* Fixed a bug in FW_FORWARD_MASQ - demasquerading decision was too
	  global and superseded any other rule for the same port

v3.0	06.08.02
	* Added 1.) FW_QUICKMODE which will replace SuSE-personalfirewall.
	  If set to yes, it will act similar to the personalfirewall
	  tool and only react to FW_DEV_EXT and FW_MASQ_DEV options.
	* Fixed a bug where FW_FORWARD would not work with icmp types
	* Added option 26.) FW_REJECT to send reject packets for disallowed
	  packets.
	* Added all those many patches of Kurt Garloff & other SuSE team
	  members, to make it SuSE 8.0, lsb, init-style, yast2 and
	  United Linux compliant.
	  MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE: The config is now in
	  /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 and there is no START_FW2 option
	  anymore - if there is a link in the runlevel directory, it will
	  start!
	  REJECTED PATCH LIST:	SuSEfirewall2-2.1.keep_route.diff
				SuSEfirewall2-2.1.no-rmmod.diff
				SuSEfirewall2-2.1.newrc.diff
	  keep_route would result in an insecure system after
	  "SuSEfirewall stop", no-rmmod was an old work-around for a kernel
	  bug in 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and newrc would not allow SuSEfirewall2 to
	  run on old SuSE or non-SuSE systems.

v2.2	12.02.02	GAMMA
	* Added "easy" mode which rejects all incoming connections.
	  You do not need to config firewall2.rc.config for this.
	* Added "force" paramter to load rules even if START_FW2 is not "yes"
	* Added support to define a target IP address to FW_FORWARD_MASQ
	  which is needed if you want to reverse masquerade several web
	  servers or similar.
	* Added a small patch to the _final init script which will be skipped
	  if the the autoprotecting feature is disabled - so only reason why
	  the _final script exists ...
	* Ensuring english language during the script running for parsing
	* Small beautifications
	* FW_STOP_KEEP_ROUTING_STATE was ignored. fixed (thanks to joerg@schueler-maroldt.de)
	* The ports and protocols in the ipsec example in EXAMPLES were
	  missing. (thanks to ulmer@uta-leasing.de)

v2.1	08.12.01	GAMMA
	* Added '!' support to FW_REDIRECT (thanks to rkooijman@inergy.nl)
	* FW_ALLOW_*_HIGH_PORT change: related connections are now always
	  allowed. Therefore changed the default of the options.
	* Added patch from <ervee@moskovic.org> for better log output. thanks!

v2.0	11.11.01	GAMMA
	* Fixed a typo which created problems for some ADSL users
	* Added runlevel fixes by Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de>

v1.9	03.11.01	GAMMA
	* v1.8 somehow fucked up while packaging, no changes

v1.8	28.10.01	GAMMA
	* Fixed private network detection fro FW_MASQ_NETS

v1.7	28.08.01	GAMMA	(-> SuSE 7.3)
	* The INSTALL tool did not install the EXAMPLES file, fixed. (thanks
	  to ingo.kley@web.de)
	* Fixed a bug in FW_FORWARD_MASQ when target ports were ranges.
	  (thanks to Rene@Hoppe-Online.de and christos@teacat.net)
	* Fixed some bugs in the documentation.
	* When stopping SuSEfirewall2, all modules are now removed.

v1.6	26.07.01	GAMMA
	* Added error checking for FW_MASQ_NETS because I got too many reports
	  of users who told me that the filter rules blocked sites without a
	  reason just because they set 192.168.0.0/8 instead of 192.168.0.0/24
	  This wastes too much of my time ...
	* Added an additional EXAMPLE with an ipsec setup, also wrote an FAQ
	  section about that.

v1.5	21.07.01	GAMMA
	* Fixed a typo in firewall.rc.config which resulted in an error for
	  logging. thanks to Lutz.Jaenicke@aet.TU-Cottbus.DE

v1.4	21.07.01	GAMMA
	* Added FW_SERVICE_SQUID to support special squid UDP ports (where
	  one of them is dynamic ...)
	* Fixed a long, long bug which resulted in timeouts for the first
	  DNS lookup which triggered autodialing
	* Changed firewall.rc.config format to be yast compliant
       --- the following fixes were done by Kurt for the v1.3 rpm release:
	* rcfirewall2 points now to SuSEfirewall_setup
	* Many, many spelling fixes!

v1.3	14.07.01	FINAL	-> FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE
	* Fixed a bug in autoprotecting ports to externals (thanks to
	  sielaff@chem.tu-berlin.de and D.Markwardt@tu-bs.de)
	* Added special log message if internals try to access the external
	  IPs of the firewall
	* Added missing /sbin/rcSuSEfirewall2 link (thanks to
	  wolfgang.hoefler@hwo.at)

v1.2	01.07.01	GAMMA
	* Fixed 5 small bugs in logging functions (which resulted in
	  "unknown option --syn" messages in special occasions)
	* Added the new option FW_IGNORE_FW_BROADCAST in addition to
	  FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST if broadcasts should not be allowed but
	  ignored to prevent the annoying log entries

v1.1	23.06.01	GAMMA
	* Fixed a small bug in FW_TRUSTED_NETS
	* People with German/French etc. language sets for root could not
	  run this script because the output of ifconfig etc. is different.
	  I hope I could fix this.
	* Fixed the backup function of /etc/ip-up in INSTALL
	* Added a mss iptables rule which seems to be needed for adsl
	* Support for weird lsof binaries :-)
	* Fixed some minor things in ip-up

v1.0	11.06.01	GAMMA
	-> believe it or not - v1.0 is ready to go and should work
	   perfectly for everyone! :-)
	* Added the new ip-up script which supports
		SuSE-personalfirewall, SuSEfirewall(1) and SuSEfirewall2
	* Added a patch by <martin.schulz@videotron.ca>, which fixes some
	  error checking - thanks!
	* Added loading of a kernel module which is necessary for active ftp
	  (thanks to christian.ernst@informatik.fh-hamburg.de)
	* Added support for devices with no broadcast address (e.g. ipsec stuff)
	* Autoprotecting mode supports ipv6 global bindings (:::1) now
	* Fixed a bug in the UDP autoprotecting mode support
	* Removed TOS stuff for ICMP - resulted in no ping packets being
	  sent. Seems to be a kernel bug :-( netfilter still sucks ...
	* Updated the documentation
	* Added bootp config support for interfaces
	* Added a small README and a converted EXAMPLES file

v0.9	06.05.01	BETA
	* Rewrote the TOS stuff. Routed packets were not affected and I
	  made another setup error. duh
	* Allowing NEW connections to high ports (FW_ALLOW_INCOMING_HIGHPORTS)
	  This seems to be needed to get the behaviour people expect :-(

v0.7	29.04.01	BETA
	* Fixed a small bug in INSTALL (thanks to cognac@toppoint.de)
	* Fixed two references for the old firewall.rc.config file (thanks to
	  denecke@fh-muenster.de)
	* Beware that iptables does *not* support aliases, wildcards etc.!
	  However I implemented some tricks so you can supply e.g.
	  FW_DEV_EXT="eth0 eth0:1" and everything still works

v0.6	09.04.01	BETA
	* Fixed TOS setting - I got it completely wrong ;-)) thanks to
	  <marco.ahrendt@adconsys.de>
	* Fixed erroneous description of FW_REDIRECT in firewall2.rc.config

v0.5	14.03.01	ALPHA
	* Fixed FW_SERVICE_DNS for bind-9.1 with ipv6 support, also several
	  instances of bind are now allowed (for split-brain DNS)
	* When FW_PROTECT_FROM_INTERNAL was set to no, FW_AUTOPROTECT_SERVICES
	  would protect against internal and vice versa. fixed.

v0.4	06.03.01	ALPHA
	* Changed the START_FW variable to START_FW2 so you can have
	  installed both SuSEfirewall(1) and SuSEfirewall2 in parallel
	  without problems
	* Fixed a bug in INSTALL where the K99 stop script was incorrectly
	  symlinked.
	* Fixed a bug in the masquerading. should work now.
	  (thanks to jboonen@worldonline.nl)
	* Fixed dumb warnings and typos
	* Fixed a bug in FW_FORWARD for tcp and udp
	  (for both bug reports thanks to christian.esser@gmx.de>

v0.3	28.02.01	ALPHA
	* Tested most stuff and it works for me. Now lets do some alpha
	  testing with the users ;-)

v0.2	28.02.01	unreleased

	* Small typo fixes
	* Rewrote firewall.rc.config for SuSEfirewall2

v0.1	27.02.01	unreleased
	* Completely rewrote SuSEfirewall2 with the basics from SuSEfirewall(1)

v0.0	26.02.01	started!
