WHAT IS SuSEFIREWALL2
--------------------
SuSEfirewall2 is a wrapper for the firewall setup tool for the
kernel.

Setting up proper filter rules is difficult and time consuming.
Therefore this script was developed to
	a) set up highly secure filter rules
	b) be easy to configure itself
So it is a very good tool for both novice users and firewall
experts.

HOW DO I SET UP SuSEFIREWALL
----------------------------
First use the runlevel editor to enable SuSEfirewall2 in your
runlevel (3 or 5 most likely). It sets the symlinks for the
SuSEfirewall2_* scripts in the /etc/init.d/rc?.d/ directories.

Well, then you just edit /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 with your
favourite editor. Read the commented lines carefully. They give you
many hints and tips for the configuration! If you are stuck or need
additional hints, take a look at the
/usr/share/doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/EXAMPLES file

Most problems will arise in two areas.
a) "I want to allow access to my application XYZ on my firewall"
These need to be set in FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP etc. but the common
problem is about the port the application uses. Let's say you are
running an irc daemon and want to allow this service. Execute "lsof
-i -n -P" and look for irc. You will see a line like this: ircd
1275 irc     5u  IPv4   3097       TCP *:6667 (LISTEN) This 6667 is
the number you are looking for. Put this into e.g.
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP and execute SuSEfirewall2 again.

b) "I want to allow access to application XYZ on my internal windows
machine" For this you have to use FW_FORWARD_MASQ and again, you
need to find out the port numbers to put in there. Read the
documentation of the application or run something like tcpdump to
find this out. If you still have got problems - sorry, you are on
your own here. Ask your friends. The EXAMPLES file shows you the
syntax and some uses.


A WORD ABOUT SECURITY
---------------------
As the SuSEfirewall scripts are just frontends for ipchains/iptables
which set up the kernel filters - this is not the best security you
can get. If you have to protect a company network, you have to set
up a proper security infrastructure with multi-tier security. Get a
book (e.g. Building Internet Firewalls, O'Reilly, Chapman & Zwicky)
or a professional consultant (e.g. SuSE or KPMG :-). It is important
in such a setup is that you are not doing masquerading or routing
with this firewall server. All communication with the internet and
other networks should only run via chrooted proxies, or machines in
the DMZ. If you already do not know what I am talking about: read
the book and/or get a consultant.
