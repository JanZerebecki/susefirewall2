## Description:	Historical simplified firewall configuration
## Type:	string
#
# The variable REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS provides backwards
# compatibility legacy support for SuSEpersonal-firewall (package
# personal-firewall). Today, the package SuSEfirewall2 takes over
# the functionality.
# The framework  around  REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS designed
# to provide an  extremely easy configuration of  simple firewall
# rules. There is only one variable:
# Set  REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS to one of the values below
# if you wish to have all incoming connections blocked.
#
# possible values:
# no	don't place any rules.
# yes	This is not supported any more. It used to reject connections
#       on all interfaces, but SuSEfirewall2 will write an error message
#       and exit unsuccessfully.
# iface	reject incoming connections as well as UDP traffic on the
# 	interface "iface". More names for interfaces can be added,
# 	seperated by space. Example:
#	REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS="eth0 ippp0"
#	this rejects everything on the first ethernet card as well as the
# 	ISDN interface.
# masq	if the interface name is "masq", then all packets that arrive will
#	be masqueraded (NAT) when they arrive at an interface we don't
# 	reject packets from. Setting masq is useless together with "yes".
#	This option requires IP_FORWARD from /etc/sysconfig/sysctl
#	to be set to "yes".
#	"masq" and the interface name must be space-seperated. Example:
#	REJECT_ALL_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS="ippp0 masq"
#	will reject all connection attempts to the ippp0 interface but not
# 	the ethernet interface. All outbound traffic gets masqueraded.
#
# See /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 for more details.
#
# Side effects: Protocols that open secondary TCP connections will be
# rendered useless. Among these are ftp (PORT mode), irc (DCC mode, CTCP),
# quake, real-audio, real-video. If you need to use these, you must turn off
# the firewall to enable them again.
#
# Please note that you can't log on to your host from the network any more
# if SuSEfirewall2 in the personal-firewall compatibility mode is active.
#
# the default is off (do nothing).
# A value other than "" or "no" will override the settings for
# SuSEfirewall2.
