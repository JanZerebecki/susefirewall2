1.  How do I allow access to my application XYZ on my firewall?

    Usually you need an entry in FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP or FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP. The
    most common problem is to determine which port the application uses. Let's say
    you are running an apache web server and want to allow access to it. Execute
    netstat -tunlp and look for httpd. You will see a line like this:

    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4497/httpd

    The number 80 is the port you are looking for. In this example put it into
    FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP and execute SuSEfirewall2 again.

2.  How can I reduce the generated rule set as much as possible?

      ● Set FW_PROTECT_FROM_INTERNAL to "no"

      ● Disable Logging

      ● Set all FW_ALLOW_* and FW_SERVICE_* to no

      ● Do not use routing or masquerading

      ● Only enable routing/services you really need and make the statements as
        general as possible to reduce the number of definitions. Then you will have
        got much less rules, but also a lesser security. Better spend 50$ on a
        faster processor and more ram instead of using an old 486 as firewall.

3.  How can I be sure that the firewall rules are active when I connect to the
    internet?

    Make sure that the SuSEfirewall2 boot scripts are enabled and that /etc/
    sysconfig/network/config contains FIREWALL=yes. Also check that the /etc/
    sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* files don't contain FIREWALL="no". You can check
    whether packet filtering rules are actually installed with the command
    SuSEfirewall2 status

4.  How many interfaces are supported for each zone (EXT/DMZ/INT)?

    Any number you want

5.  Why is communication between two interfaces in the same zone not working?

    For security reasons, no network may communicate to another until configured
    otherwise. Even if both are "trusted" internal networks. You can allow full
    traffic with FW_ALLOW_CLASS_ROUTING or specifying all allowed traffic with
    FW_FORWARD. Keep in mind that this affects all interfaces in all zones.

6.  I have set a web server in my DMZ. How do I configure SuSEfirewall2 to let
    people on the internet access my pages?

    Lets say your web server has got an official IP address of 1.1.1.1 which you
    received from your ISP. You would just configure FW_FORWARD_TCP like this:

    FW_FORWARD="0/0,1.1.1.1,tcp,80"

7.  What if my Server has a private IP address, how do I enable external access
    then?

    You can use reverse masquerading. For this you need to set FW_ROUTE and
    FW_MASQUERADE to "yes", and additionally FW_FORWARD_MASQ for the web servers
    private IP (lets say it is 10.0.0.1):

    FW_ROUTE="yes"
    FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
    FW_FORWARD_MASQ="0/0,10.0.0.1,tcp,80"

8.  Some service does not work when the firewall is enabled. How do I find out
    what's wrong?

    Enable logging of all dropped packets and disable the log limit in /etc/
    sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2:

    FW_LOG_DROP_CRIT="yes"
    FW_LOG_DROP_ALL="yes"
    FW_LOG_LIMIT="no"

    Run SuSEfirewall2 again. /var/log/messages will now quickly fill up with log
    messages about dropped packets when you try to use the not working service.
    Those messages tell you the protocol and port you need to open.

    You may also run SuSEfirewall2 in test mode: SuSEfirewall2 test. Then try to
    connect to the service in a way which failed before. It will work because
    SuSEfirewall2 does not actually filter any packets this time. However, it will
    still log all packets it normally would have dropped.

    If everything works again don't forget to set the log options back to normal to
    not fill up you log files.

9.  Some web site that offers port scanning claims my system is not protected
    properly as it still responds to ICMP echo requests (ping)

    ICMP echo requests are harmless however they are a fundametal means to
    determine whether hosts are still reachable. Blocking them would seriously
    impact the ability to track down network problems. It is therefore not
    considered nice behaviour for an internet citizen to drop pings.

10. Can't the evil guys detect whether my host is online if it responds to ICMP
    echo requests?

    Yes but they can detect that anyways. The router at your provider behaves
    different depending on whether someone is dialed in or not.

11. SuSEfirewall2 drops most packets but it doesn't fully hide the presence of my
    machine. Isn't that a security hole?

    You machine is never fully invisible, see previous question. The purpose of
    dropping packets is not to hide your machine but to slow down port scans.

12. The ipsec0 interface I had with kernel 2.4 is gone. How do I assign IPsec
    traffic to a different zone now?

    Set the variable FW_IPSEC_TRUST to the zone you would have put the ipsec0 into
    before. For example if your IPsec tunnel is set up on the external interface
    but you want to grant the decrypted traffic access to all your services as if
    it was in the internal zone:

    FW_IPSEC_TRUST="int"
    FW_SERVICES_EXT_IP="esp"
    FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP="isakmp"
    FW_PROTECT_FROM_INT="no"

13. Why is SuSEfirewall2 so slow? / Can't you just use iptables-restore?

    SuSEfirewall2 is implemented in bourne shell which is not exactly the fastest
    thing on earth especially if it has that much work to do as SuSEfirewall2.
    Administrators still prefer bourne shell scripts because of readability *cough*
    . To be able to use iptables-restore SuSEfirewall2 would need a lot more logic
    than what is be possible with bourne shell as it would need to sort and reorder
    the rules for example. Furthermore interfaces are not static. They can
    arbitrarily appear and disapper with different names so a generic solution
    can't just dump the rules with iptables-store and re-apply them with
    iptables-restore.

14. Enabling drbd blocks the boot process. How to get around that?

    During boot process all incoming traffic is blocked unconditionally. The very
    last boot script then sets up the configured firewall rules. The problem is
    that drbd blocks the boot process while waiting for incoming connection from
    other nodes. Therefore configuring the drbd port in SuSEfirewall2 has no
    effect.

      ● SLES10

        Add a manual iptables call to /etc/init.d/boot.local:

        iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7788 -j ACCEPT

      ● SLES11, openSUSE <= 11.2

        On SLES11 SuSEfirewall2_init is called after boot.local, therefore the
        method for SLES10 doesn't work anymore. It's possible to modify the
        dependencies of the SuSEfirewall2_setup script to run before drbd though:

          ○ Create the directory /etc/insserv/overrides

          ○ Create a new file /etc/insserv/overrides/SuSEfirewall2_setup

          ○ Copy the the LSB header (the part between and including the lines "###
            BEGIN INIT INFO" and "### END INIT INFO") from /etc/init.d/
            SuSEfirewall2_setup to /etc/insserv/overrides/SuSEfirewall2_setup

          ○ Replace $ALL with $null and add the following line:

            # X-Start-Before: drbd

          ○ run /sbin/insserv

      ● openSUSE >= 11.3

        Configure the open ports for drbd and set

        FW_BOOT_FULL_INIT="yes"
