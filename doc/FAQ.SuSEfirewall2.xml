      <question>
	<para>
	  I want to allow access to my application XYZ on my firewall
	</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
	<para>
	  These need to be set in <varname>FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP</varname> or
	  <varname>FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP</varname> The common problem is about
	  what port the application uses. Let's say you are running
	  an apache web server server and want to allow this
	  service. Execute <command>netstat -tunlp</command> and
	  look for httpd. You will see a line like this:
	  <informalexample>
	    <screen>tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4497/httpd</screen>
	  </informalexample>
	  The number 80 is the port you are looking for. In this example put it
	  into <varname>FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP</varname> and execute SuSEfirewall2
	  again.

      <question>
	<para>
	  How can I reduce the generated rule set as much as possible?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Set <varname>FW_PROTECT_FROM_INTERNAL</varname> to no
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Disable Logging
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Set all <varname>FW_ALLOW_*</varname> and
	      <varname>FW_SERVICE_*</varname> to no
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Do not use routing or masquerading
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Only enable routing/services you really need and make the statements
	      as general as possible to reduce the number of definitions.
	      Then you will have got much less rules, but also a lesser security.
	      Better spend 50$ on a faster processor more ram instead of using
	      an old 486 as firewall.

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  How can I be sure that after I dial-in to the internet the firewall
	  rules are active?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  Make sure that <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/config</filename>
	  contains <literal>FIREWALL=yes</literal> and it's not overridden by
	  <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename> files. You can
	  check the firewall rules with the command <command>SuSEfirewall2
	    status</command>
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  How many interfaces are supported for each zone (EXT/DMZ/INT)?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  Any number you want
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  If I enter two internal network cards, communication between the two
	  networks connected to the firewall is not possible. However both can
	  access the internet.
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  This works as designed. For security reasons, no network may communicate
	  to another until configured otherwise. Even if both are "trusted"
	  internal networks. You can allow full traffic with
	  <varname>FW_ALLOW_CLASS_ROUTING</varname> or specifying all allowed
	  traffic with <varname>FW_FORWARD</varname>. Keep in mind that this
	  affects all interfaces in all zones.
	</para>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  I have set a web server in my DMZ. How do I configure SuSEfirewall2 to let
	  people on the internet access my pages?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  Lets say your web server has got an official
	  IP address of 1.1.1.1 which you received from your ISP. You would
	  just configure <varname>FW_FORWARD_TCP</varname> like this:
	  <informalexample>
	    <programlisting>FW_FORWARD="0/0,1.1.1.1,tcp,80"</programlisting>
	  </informalexample>
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  I don't have an official IP address for the web server. I have only
	  one, and thats my external Firewall IP address. What can I do?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  You can use reverse masquerading. For this you need to set
	  <varname>FW_ROUTE</varname> and <varname>FW_MASQUERADE</varname> to
	  <literal>"yes"</literal>, and additionally
	  <varname>FW_FORWARD_MASQ</varname> for the web servers private IP
	  (lets say it is 10.0.0.1):
	  <informalexample>
	    <programlisting>
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_FORWARD_MASQ="0/0,10.0.0.1,tcp,80"</programlisting>
	  </informalexample>
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>I get some service not working. However it works if I disable the firewall.
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  Run SuSEfirewall2 in test mode: "SuSEfirewall2 test". Then try to
	  connect to the service in a way which failed before. It will work
	  because SuSEfirewall2 will *not* filter any packets. However, it
	  will log all packets to syslog it normally would have filtered. So
	  just check out the last lines in
	  <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> to see which ports you have to
	  open/forward to get the service running with SuSEfirewall2.
	</para>
      </answer>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  Some web site that offers port scanning claims my system is not
	  protected properly as it still responds to ICMP echo requests (ping)
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  ICMP echo requests are harmless however they are a fundametal means
	  to determine whether hosts are still reachable. Blocking them would
	  seriously impact the ability to track down network problems and is
	  therefore no nice behaviour for an internet citizen.
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  Can't the evil guys detect whether my host is online if it responds
	  to ICMP echo requests?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  Yes but they can detect that anyways. The router at your provider
	  behaves different depending on whether someone is dialed in or not.
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  SuSEfirewall2 drops most packets but it doesn't fully hide the
	  presence of my machine. Isn't that a security hole?
	</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
	<para>
	  You machine is never fully invisible, see previous question. The
	  purpose of dropping packets is not to hide your machine but to slow
	  down port scans.
	</para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question>
	<para>
	  I've set up my machine as IPsec server but it doesn't work as soon as
	  SuSEfirewall2 is enabled.
