Important

All options not mentioned in a scenario should be left as they are in the
default sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 config file. Backup default config: /usr/share/
doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/SuSEfirewall2.sysconfig

1. Simple home network using Wi-Fi DSL router

Today most ISP connections are done using a feature rich Wi-Fi DSL router, that
possibly provides wired Ethernet connections as well. The DSL router performs
masquerading to the internet. One or more isolated SUSE Linux machines want to
connect to the internet but need not to communicate with each other. eth0 is
the wired or Wi-Fi ethernet device connected to the DSL router:

FW_DEV_EXT="eth0"

Alternatively, if the internal machines want to exchange data with each other
and the DSL router is trusted and configured to perform appropriate
masquerading/filtering/forwarding then the associated ethernet device can be
treated as internal:

FW_DEV_INT="eth0"

2. Small home network

A family owns multiple PCs, a SUSE Linux PC is connected to the internet via
DSL. The family's LAN uses private IPs therefore masquerading has to be used.
The Firewall provides no services whatsoever. The address of the LAN is
192.168.10.0/24.

FW_DEV_EXT="dsl0"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0"
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_MASQ_NETS="192.168.10.0/24"

3. Small home network with additional WLAN

Same network as above but additionally the Firewall is also connected to a
wireless network. Hosts in the wireless network should get internet access but
are not allowed to communicate with the internal network. The address of the
WLAN is 192.168.20.0/24.

FW_ZONES="wlan"
FW_DEV_EXT="dsl0"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0"
FW_DEV_wlan="wlan0"
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_MASQ_NETS="192.168.10.0/24 192.168.20.0/24"

4. Small company with external mail and web server

A company uses it's SUSE Linux PC to access the internet via DSL or other
similar kind of broadband ISP connection. It has got a static IP address and a
web server running on the PC plus it's mail-/pop3-server for the company. Squid
is running to cache www traffic. No internal PC should have direct access to
the internet. The LAN is connected to the interface eth0.

FW_DEV_EXT="dsl0"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="smtp www"
FW_SERVICES_INT_TCP="smtp domain www pop3 3128"
FW_SERVICES_INT_UDP="domain"
FW_PROTECT_FROM_INT="yes"

5. Company with IPsec tunnel to subsidiary

A small company wants access to the internet for it's client PCs. Additionally
the subsidiariaries client PCs should get access to the local network through
an IPsec tunnel. Internet traffic should be masqueraded but not traffic between
subsidiaries.

external interface: dsl0
internal interface: eth0
internal LAN: 10.10.0.0/16
remote LAN: 192.168.0.0/24

FW_DEV_EXT="dsl0"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0"
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP="isakmp"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_IP="esp"
FW_FORWARD="10.10.0.0/16,192.168.1.0/24,,,ipsec 192.168.1.0/24,10.10.0.0/16,,,ipsec"
FW_MASQ_NETS="0/0,!192.168.1.0/24

Warning

Setting up IPsec and a firewall is no guarantee for safe communication! Use
packet sniffers such as tcpdump or wireshark to verify the traffic is actually
sent through the IPsec tunnel. Check the packet counts in the output of 
SuSEfirewall2 status. The ESP accepting rule must increase it's counter when
encrypted traffic is supposed to flow.

6. Company with web server in DMZ

This company has got a more complex setup:

Internet
|
|           Web server
|               |
SUSE-Firewall----
|
|---Mail server
|
|---Database
|
Internal LAN


All Mail is delivered to the firewall. It also provides DNS service for the
internal and external networks. There's a DMZ where a Web server resides (port
80 and port 443) which needs to connect to the Firewall to deliver mail to the
internal network, send syslog messages and do DNS lookups. It needs also direct
access to an internal database (bad idea!). All mail which is delivered to the
firewall, is sent to the internal mail server. The mail server sends all mail
destined for the internet to the firewall. Internal PCs which access the
internet should be masqueraded.

external interface: eth2
DMZ interface: eth1
internal interface: eth0
IP of database: 192.168.1.3
TCP port of database: 4545
IP of web server: 200.200.200.200 (an official, assigned address!)
internal LAN: 192.168.1.0/24

Note

The name server on the firewall needs to be setup "split-brained". See the DNS
HOWTO.

The mail server on the firewall needs to be setup as a relay for the internal
network. The mail server on the internal network has to use the firewall host
as relay.

FW_DEV_EXT="eth2"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0"
FW_DEV_DMZ="eth1"
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_MASQ_NETS="192.168.1.0/24"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="smtp domain"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP="domain"
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_TCP="smtp domain"
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_UDP="domain syslog"
FW_SERVICES_INT_TCP="smtp domain"
FW_SERVICES_INT_UDP="domain"
# access to the web server and allow access from the web server to the database
FW_FORWARD="0/0,200.200.200.200,tcp,80 \
    0/0,200.200.200.200,tcp,443 \
    200.200.200.200,192.168.1.3,tcp,4545"
# all DNS and mail is done by the firewall
FW_REDIRECT="192.168.1.0/24,0/0,tcp,53,53 \
    192.168.1.0/24,0/0,tcp,25,25 \
    192.168.1.0/24,0/0,udp,53,53"
FW_ALLOW_PING_DMZ="yes"

The redirect statements in this example are gimmicks to show how to use them.
In this example they send any traffic from the internal network, which go via
the firewall and a are destined to a target port of 53 (DNS) or 25 (Mail) to
the local servers on the firewall.

7. Complex scenario

Internet
|
|      Trusted_Company
|      |
|      |
SUSE-Firewall----Web server
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |-- Admin Network
|
Internal LAN---Server (for the trusted_company)
|
Mail server


The company has a connection to the internet but also to an additional line to
a trusted third party company, who needs SSH Access to an internal server
("Server" on the map). There is also a DMZ with a web server (www, https) which
sends DNS, mail and syslog to the firewall. The web server has got a private IP
Address, hence it must be reverse masqueraded. It gets being administrated with
SSH from the Admin LAN. The Admin Network should be masqueraded to the internet
and get full access. The Internal LAN should also be masqueraded to the
internet but only be allowed to access www, https and ftp. Only TCP connections
from the Admin network to the internal LAN should be allowed, not from the
internal LAN to the Admin network. No traffic between the internet and the
trusted company should be allowed. The firewall receives all mails and sends
them to an internal mail server or to the internet. It also provides DNS
service to it's internal/dmz networks.

external interface: eth4
trusted_company interface: eth3
DMZ interface: eth2
internal interface: eth1
admin interface: eth0
IP of web server : 10.0.10.2
IP of mail server: 10.0.2.2
IP of Server (for trusted_company): 10.0.2.3
Internal LAN: 10.0.2.0/24
Admin LAN: 10.0.1.0/24
Trusted_company LAN: 192.168.1.0/24

The mail server on the firewall needs to be setup as a relay for the internal
network. The mail server on the internal network has to use the firewall host
as relay.

FW_DEV_EXT="eth3 eth4"
FW_DEV_INT="eth0 eth1"
FW_DEV_DMZ="eth2"
FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
# full access for Admin LAN, www/https/ftp for internal
FW_MASQ_NETS="10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24,,tcp,21 10.0.2.0/24,,tcp,80 \
    10.0.2.0/24,,tcp,443"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="smtp"
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_TCP="smtp domain"
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_UDP="domain syslog"
FW_SERVICES_INT_TCP="smtp domain"
FW_SERVICES_INT_UDP="domain"
FW_FORWARD="10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24,tcp 10.0.1.0/24,10.0.10.2,tcp,22"
# internet access to web server and trusted company access to internal Server
FW_FORWARD_MASQ="0/0,10.0.10.2,tcp,80 0/0,10.0.10.2,tcp,443 \
192.168.1.0/24,10.0.2.3,tcp,22"

8. Laptop in private network but with additional public IP adresses

Internet
|
|
|
Router
|
|
LAN -- Laptop with SuSEfirewall2
|
|
LAN Server


The LAN uses private IP addresses, masquerading is performed by a hardware
router or another SuSEfirewall2 host. In addition to the LAN IP the laptop got
an official IP address as well. The laptop has only one network interface and
wants to offer ssh. The router forwards all traffic for that IP address to the
laptop.

network interface: eth0
official IP of laptop: 200.200.200.200
internal LAN: 192.168.1.0/24

Since all traffic is forwarded to the laptop eth0 must be considered
untrustworthy, i.e. external.

FW_DEV_EXT="eth0"
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="ssh"
FW_TRUSTED_NETS="192.168.1.0/24"

Note that broadcasts are blocked in the external zone by default. You may
change that to allow them in this scenario.
